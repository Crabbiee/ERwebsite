    <h1 class="h1">Quality build: Boring but effective!</h1>
    <p>A General purpose melee build allowing you to be a jack of all trades but master of none.  Whilst not as overpowered as the other builds, it can still be very effective and allow for a flexible approach to the game. The fact it will allow you to use the majority of weapons makes it highly recommended for a fun, varied and most of all balanced first playthrough.</p>

    <div class ="textbox" id = "center"><h2 class ="h2">Stats</h2>
        <p>This is a rough outline of the stats you should be aiming for.<br> 
        Treat this is a general guide and not a rigid ruleset, which means do not be afraid to deviate if you say find a cool magic sword and need some INT, or find yourself suddenly wanting to become a strength powerhouse! Do what you <b>enjoy</b>.</p>
    <p><b><u>Strength</u></b><br>Increasing your strength will increase your damage. Your target strength is level 60.<br>
    <b><u>Dexterity</u></b><br>Increasing your dexterity will increase your damage. Your target dexterity is level 60.<br>
    <b><u>Vigor</u></b><br>This is your health, the higher the better. Vigor should be anywhere from level 35 to level 60.<br>
    <b><u>Endurance</u></b><br>Endurance effects the amount of stamina you have and how much armor you can equip. Endurance can be anywhere from level 25 to level 60.<br>
    <b><u>Mind</u></b><br>Mind is how much FP or mana you have, allowing you to use more weapon abilities. Base level is fine but if you find yourself using a lot of weapon arts do not be afraid to invest.

    <div class ="textbox" id = "center"><h2 class="h2">Talismans</h2>
    <p><img class="talismansize" src="image/turtle.png" alt="green turtle talisman"><br>
        <b><u>Green turtle talisman</u></b><br>This will massively increase your stamina regen, very useful for melee fighters.<br>
        <img class="talismansize" src="image/greatjar.png" alt="great-jars arsenal"><br>
    <b><u>Great Jars Arsenal</u></b><br>This massively increases your equip load allowing you to equip heavier armour with less endurance investment.<br>
    <img class="talismansize" src="image/amber.png" alt="viridian amber medallion"><br>
    <b><u>Viridian amber medallion</u></b><br>This will massively increase your total stamina allowing you to attack or sprint for much longer. Very powerful when used with the green turtle <br>
    <img class="talismansize" src="image/erdtree.png" alt="erdtrees favour"><br>
    <b><u>Erdtrees favor</u></b><br>This will give a small boost to maximum stamina, HP and equip load allowing your character to be just a little more powerful.

<div class ="textbox"><h2 class="h2" id="center">Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Do not be afraid to try things out. The joy of a quality build is its versatility! Cool spear? Poke away! Neat hammer? BONKBONK!</li>
        <li>Prioritise raising stamina and vigor first. Survivability and the ability to keep swinging/rolling are very important. Do not neglect str/dex though!</li>
      </ul></p></div>
